## Iteration 2 Lecture 8A

Update from last week
- Change the clock rotation mechanism from dragging (left clockwise and right counter-clockwise) to icons to simplify the rotation mechanism and make it more obvious to rotate the clock hands
- Update the Dialogue for prisoner 3 to make it more obvious to find the birthday of the prison
- Have other prisoners (except prisoner 3) have repeated dialogue directing the player to other prisoners after the dialogue is completed once to reduce confusion on where the clues to puzzles are.
- Update the design of the prison to make it more cohesive with the scheme and add a prison bar for all prisoners
- Update the design of the chest lock to make it more intuitive and easier to enter the password
- Add the simple circle map to indicate where the player is
- Update the icon and loading screen to match our scheme.
